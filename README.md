# Lexicon XML Generator

## Overview

The Lexicon XML Generator is a simple Single Page Application (SPA) built using JavaScript and Materialize CSS. This application allows users to input grapheme-phoneme pairs (or aliases), edit existing entries, and generate/download an XML file formatted according to lexicon XML standards. Users can also upload an XML file to view its contents in the application. See demo - https://pronunciation-generator.vercel.app/
